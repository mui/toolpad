## Advantages of Toolpad

- **Build faster than ever before:** measure your development time in minutes rather than hours or days—simply drag and drop the components you need.
- **Extensible with code:** build low-code with pro-code extensibility. You can write JavaScript anywhere in Toolpad as soon as you feel limited by the built-in features.
- **Connect to any data source:** Toolpad lets you work with HTTP endpoints, Google Sheets, or PostgreSQL for backend functionality.

## Toolpad terminology

- **Navigation**: where you can return to the homepage, or preview or deploy your app.
- **Explorer**: where you can define and manage pages, connection configurations, custom component definitions, and more.
- **Component library**: where you can find components to drag and drop onto the Canvas.
- **Canvas**: where you build the UI for your application.
