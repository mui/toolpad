## Paid Plan

A few features in Toolpad are proposed to be placed under a paid plan. These:

- will not be covered under the free-forever MIT license
- will require the purchase of a paid license to use in production

The following features are currently planned to be included within this scope:

- ### Authorization

  Features allowing you to grant conditional access to pages based on user roles are part of this proposed paid plan. Read more about this feature on [authorization](/toolpad/concepts/rbac/).

## How to upgrade

Currently, accessing these features requires you to add the following to your `application.yml`:

```yml
spec: { plan: pro }
```

:::info
Add the above alongside any existing content of the `spec` attribute

Using these features in production will require the purchase of a paid license. Please get in touch with us at [toolpad@mui.com](mailto:toolpad@mui.com) if you require to do so.
