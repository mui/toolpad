# useNotifications

<p class="description">Imperative APIs to show and interact with application notifications.</p>

:::info
If this is your first time using Toolpad Core, it's recommended to read about the [basic concepts](/toolpad/core/introduction/base-concepts/) first.
:::

Toolpad Core offers a set of abstractions that make it easier to interact with notifications. Notifications are used to give short updates to the user about things that are happening during the application lifetime. They appear at the bottom of the screen. The Toolpad API allows for opening multiple notifications concurrenlty.

First thing you need to do to get access to the notifications APIs is install the NotificationsProvider.

```js
import { NotificationsProvider } from '@toolpad/core/useNotifications';

function App({ children }) {
  return <NotificationsProvider>{children}</NotificationsProvider>;
}
```

Now you can get acess to the notifications APIs through the `useNotifications` hook.

```js
import { useNotifications } from '@toolpad/core/useNotifications';

function MyApp() {
  const notifications = useNotifications();
  // ...
}
```

:::info
The Toolpad AppProvider automatically comes with notifications installed. You won't need to explicitly add the NotificationsProvider in Toolpad applications.
:::

## Basic notification

You can notify your users with a neutral message by calling `notifications.show`. To have the notification automatically hide, add the `autoHideDuration` option. This expresses the time in milliseconds after which to close the notification.

{{"demo": "BasicNotification.js"}}

## Alert notifications

You can send notifications under the form of alerts with the `severity` property. It takes a value from `"info"`, `"success"`, `"warning"`, or `"error"`.

{{"demo": "AlertNotification.js"}}

## Multiple notifications

Multiple concurrent notifications are stacked and when more than one notification is available, a badge is shown with the amount of open notification. Try it out with the following demo:

{{"demo": "MultipleNotifications.js"}}

## Close notifications

You can programmatically close existing notifications. Each notification has an associated key. You can call the `notifications.close` method with this key to close the opened notification.

{{"demo": "CloseNotification.js"}}

## Dedupe notifications

You can supply your own value for a key to shown notifications to associate them with this key. Notifications with the same key are deduplicated as long as one is already open. If you try to show a notification with the same key, the call is simply ignored.

{{"demo": "DedupeNotification.js"}}

## Scoped notifications

Notification providers can be nested. That way you can scope the notifications to a subset of the page. Use the slots to position the snackbar relative to a specific element on the page.

{{"demo": "ScopedNotification.js"}}

## Customization

To customize the notification experience, such as the position of the notification, provide a custom [`Snackbar`](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-snackbar/) configuration to the `NotificationsProvider`. When applied at the provider level, this configuration globally sets the behavior for all notifications in your application.

```tsx
<NotificationsProvider
  slotProps={{
    snackbar: {
      anchorOrigin: { vertical: 'bottom', horizontal: 'right' },
    },
  }}
>
```

## ðŸš§ Notification center

When multiple notifications are available, click the badge to open the notification center to show a scrollable list of all available notifications. This feature is not available yet.
