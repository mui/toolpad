# Release process

1. Generate a new version using:

   ```bash
   pnpm release:version
   ```

   This command will bump the version in every package of the project.

1. Generate the changelog using:

   ```bash
   pnpm release:changelog --release master
   ```

   Running this command requires a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with the `public_repo` scope.

   Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` variable in `.env` file so to avoid passing it with command every time

   **OR**

   pass token with argument `--githubToken YOUR_TOKEN`

1. Copy the generated changelog from the console, clean it up, add a short summary of the release highlights and use the new version number as the title.

   Writing good highlights:

   - Focus on new user facing features or changes
   - Be concise, link to relevant documentation for extra clarity

   Use the following template to format the list of changes:

   ```md
   <!-- HEADER + HIGHLIGHTS -->

   ### `@toolpad/core`

   - Commit message (#pr-number) @author
   - ...

   ### Docs

   - Commit message (#pr-number) @author
   - ...

   ### Core

   - Commit message (#pr-number) @author
   - ...

   <!-- CONTRIBUTORS -->
   ```

   Strip the `[tag]` from the commit lines and order them in each section. Sections that don't have changes can be removed altogether. If necessary, improve, redact or correct commit messages.

1. Prepend the changelog to [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).

1. Open a PR to the `master` branch with the proposed changes. Add the "release" label.

1. Smoke test the release with the [CodeSandbox CI](https://ci.codesandbox.io/status/mui/toolpad) package of the PR branch:

   a. Run Toolpad Core

   ```bash
   pnpm dlx https://pkg.csb.dev/mui/toolpad/commit/<build>/create-toolpad-app smoke --core-version https://pkg.csb.dev/mui/toolpad/commit/<build>/@toolpad/core
   cd smoke
   pnpm add https://pkg.csb.dev/mui/toolpad/commit/<build>/@toolpad/core -S
   pnpm dedupe && pnpm dev
   ```

   And verify the app runs

1. Merge the PR changes, then check out the `master` branch and pull the last commit.

1. Publish the package to `npm`

   1. If you are not logged in to `npm` in your CLI, first log in with:

      ```bash
      npm login
      ```

   2. Publish to `npm`

      ```bash
      pnpm release:publish
      ```

      If you've created a prerelease, then instead use

      ```bash
      pnpm release:publish-canary
      ```

1. Publish the documentation. The documentation must be updated on the `docs-latest` branch.

   ```bash
   git push upstream master:docs-latest -f
   ```

   You can follow the deployment process on the [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mui-toolpad-docs/deploys?filter=docs-latest). Once deployed, it will be accessible at https://mui-toolpad-docs.netlify.app/.

1. [Create a new GitHub release](https://github.com/mui/toolpad/releases/new).

   1. Use `<version number>` to **Choose a tag** (when you enter new version GH UI will pop a suggestion `Create new tag: *** on publish`)
   2. Use `<commit of merged PR>` as the **target**
   3. Use the cleaned changelog as the content of **Describe this release**
   4. Use `<version number>` as the **Release title**
   5. Mark as prerelease if necessary.
   6. **Publish release**
