# Dashboard Layout

<p class="description">The dashboard layout component provides a customizable out-of-the-box layout for a typical dashboard page.</p>

:::info
If this is your first time using Toolpad Core, it's recommended to read about the [basic concepts](/toolpad/core/introduction/base-concepts/) first.
:::

The `DashboardLayout` component is a quick, easy way to provide a standard full-screen layout with a header and sidebar to any dashboard page, as well as ready-to-use and easy to customize navigation and branding.

Many features of this component are configurable through the [AppProvider](https://mui.com/toolpad/core/react-app-provider/) component that must wrap it to provide the necessary context.

:::info
For more information on the `AppProvider` component that must wrap this `DashboardLayout`, please check out the [AppProvider](https://mui.com/toolpad/core/react-app-provider/) component documentation.
:::

## Demo

A `DashboardLayout` brings in a header and sidebar with navigation, as well as a scrollable area for page content.

If application [themes](https://mui.com/toolpad/core/react-app-provider/#theming) are defined for both light and dark mode, a theme switcher in the header allows for easy switching between the two modes.

## Branding

Some elements of the `DashboardLayout` can be configured to match your personalized brand.

This can be done via the `branding` prop in the [AppProvider](https://mui.com/toolpad/core/react-app-provider/), which allows for setting a custom `logo` image or `title` text in the page header.

{{"demo": "DashboardLayoutBranding.js", "height": 400, "iframe": true}}

## Navigation

The `navigation` prop in the [AppProvider](https://mui.com/toolpad/core/react-app-provider/) allows for setting any type of navigation structure in the `DashboardLayout` sidebar by including different navigation elements as building blocks in any order.

The flexibility in composing and ordering these different elements allows for a great variety of navigation structures to fit your use case.

### Navigation Links

Navigation links can be placed in the sidebar as items with the format:

```tsx
{ segment: 'home', title: 'Home', icon: <DescriptionIcon /> }
```

{{"demo": "DashboardLayoutNavigationLinks.js", "height": 400, "iframe": true}}

### Navigation Headings

Navigation headings can be placed in the sidebar as items with the format:

```tsx
{ kind: 'header', title: 'Animals' }
```

{{"demo": "DashboardLayoutNavigationHeadings.js", "height": 400, "iframe": true}}

### Navigation Dividers

Dividers can can be placed between items in the sidebar as items with the format:

```tsx
{
  kind: 'divider';
}
```

{{"demo": "DashboardLayoutNavigationDividers.js", "height": 400, "iframe": true}}

### Nested Navigation

Nested navigation structures can be placed in the sidebar as items with the format:

```tsx
{ title: 'Movies', icon: <FolderIcon />, children: [ ... ] }
```

{{"demo": "DashboardLayoutNavigationNested.js", "height": 400, "iframe": true}}

### Navigation Actions

Navigation links have an optional `action` prop to render any content on the right-side of the respective list item, such as badges with numbers, or buttons to toggle a popover menu.

{{"demo": "DashboardLayoutNavigationActions.js", "height": 400, "iframe": true}}

### Navigation Pattern Matching

Navigation links have an optional `pattern` prop to define a pattern to be matched for the item to be marked as selected.
This feature is built on top of the [path-to-regexp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-to-regexp) library. Some examples:

- Constant path: `orders`
- Dynamic segment: `orders/:segment`
- Optional segment: `orders{/:segment}?`
- One or more segments: `orders{/:segment}+`
- Zero or more segments: `orders{/:segment}*`

{{"demo": "DashboardLayoutPattern.js", "height": 400, "iframe": true}}

### Disable collapsible sidebar

The layout sidebar is collapsible to a mini-drawer (with icons only) in desktop and tablet viewports. This behavior can be disabled with the `disableCollapsibleSidebar` prop.

{{"demo": "DashboardLayoutNoMiniSidebar.js", "height": 400, "iframe": true}}

### Full-size content

The layout content can take up the full available area with styles such as `flex: 1` or `height: 100%`.

{{"demo": "DashboardLayoutFullScreen.js", "height": 400, "iframe": true}}

### Hide navigation

The layout sidebar can be hidden if needed with the `hideNavigation` prop.

{{"demo": "DashboardLayoutSidebarHidden.js", "height": 400, "iframe": true}}

## Account

The `DashboardLayout` comes integrated with the [`<Account />`](/toolpad/core/react-account/) component. It renders as an account management menu when a user is signed in – a `session` object is present – and a button when not.

:::warning
The use of an `iframe` may cause some spacing issues in the following demo.
:::

{{"demo": "DashboardLayoutAccount.js", "height": 400, "iframe": true}}

## Customization

Some areas of the layout can be replaced with custom components by using the `slots` and `slotProps` props.
This allows you to add, for example:

- new items to the toolbar in the header, such as a search bar or button;
- footer content in the sidebar.

{{"demo": "DashboardLayoutSlots.js", "height": 400, "iframe": true}}
