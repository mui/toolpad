## Key features

- **Open-source**: Toolpad Studio is open-sourced, which means the code is free for you to observe and inspect, forever!

- **Local-first**: Toolpad Studio is a Node.js package that can be added to your existing codebase and runs locally first.

- **Low-code**: Toolpad Studio intends to let you get started with a front-end much faster, by way of a drag-and-drop editor, so that you can focus on backend code.

- **Self-hosted:** Toolpad Studio runs on your machine - which allows you to exert complete control and connect to your data without worries.

## Advantages

- **Build faster than ever before:** from first step to a finished app in a few hoursâ€”simply drag and drop the components you need.
- **Extensible with code:** build low-code with pro-code extensibility. You can write JavaScript anywhere in Toolpad Studio as soon as you feel limited by the built-in features.
- **Connect your data:** Toolpad Studio lets you return data right from server-side functions which can be automatically connected to components on the page.
- **Own your code:** All configuration is stored in local files which you can version-control, edit, git-sync and deploy in any way you want.

## Terminology

- **Explorer:** This is where you can define and manage pages and other project objects.
- **Component library:** This is where you can find components to drag and drop onto the canvas.
- **Canvas:** This is where you build the UI for your application.
- **Inspector:** This is where you can inspect and modify properties of the component selected in the canvas.
