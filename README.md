## Product walkthrough

- [Toolpad Core](https://mui.com/toolpad/core/introduction/) is a set of high level React components that abstract common concepts such as layout navigation and routing. It aims at helping you build and maintain dashboards and internal tooling faster. It's built on top of [MaterialÂ UI](http://github.com/mui/material-ui/).

- [Toolpad Studio](https://mui.com/toolpad/studio/getting-started/) is a self-hosted low-code admin builder designed to extend the Toolpad Core React components. It's for developers of all trades who want to save time building internal applications. Drag and drop from a catalog of pre-built components, connect to any data source and build apps quickly.
