# List

<p class="description">Learn about the list component and its usage in Toolpad Studio.</p>

## Usage

A List is an essential component in an application. It had one key property that makes it usable:

### itemCount

It is the number of occurences that the list is supposed to render.

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## Appearance

The List component acts as a mini canvas for other components. Each component has its own styling. The first occurence decides the appearance for the entire list.

### disablePadding

There is a predefined padding that can be enabled or disabled. It is a boolean.
