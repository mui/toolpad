# Support

<p class="description">Learn how to get support for Toolpad Studio, including feature requests, bug fixes, and technical support from the team.</p>

## GitHub

We use GitHub issues as a bug and feature request tracker.

If you think you've found a bug, or you have a new feature idea:

1. Please start by [making sure it hasn't already been reported or fixed](https://github.com/mui/toolpad/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed).
   You can search through existing issues and pull requests to see if someone has reported one similar to yours.
2. Then, if no duplicates exist, [open an issue](https://github.com/mui/toolpad/issues/new/choose) in the Toolpad repository.

### New issue guidelines

- Please follow one the issue templates provided on GitHub.
- Please use a succinct description that helps others find similar issues.
  - ‚ùå _"It doesn't work"_
  - ‚úÖ _"Add support for {{new feature}}"_
- Please don't group multiple topics in one issue.
- Please don't comment "+1" on an issue. It spams the maintainers and doesn't help move the issue forward. Use GitHub reactions instead (üëç).

### Bug reproductions

We require bug reports to be accompanied by a **minimal reproduction**.
It significantly increases the odds of fixing the problem.
