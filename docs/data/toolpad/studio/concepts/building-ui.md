Toolpad Studio has many [built-in components](/toolpad/studio/reference/components/), and more are continuously being added. To make it easier for us to understand what to add next, please [upvote](https://github.com/mui/toolpad/labels/waiting%20for%20%F0%9F%91%8D) the components you need, or open a [feature request](https://github.com/mui/toolpad/issues/new/choose).

## Using components

Each component has a set of properties that you can tweak in the **inspector panel** on the right. To view the page structure, and select or rename components, use the **page hierarchy explorer** on the bottom-left.

{{"component": "modules/components/DocsImage.tsx", "src": "/static/toolpad/docs/studio/concepts/building-ui/canvas-1.png", "alt": "Toolpad Studio panels", "caption": "Inspector panel and page hierarchy explorer" }}

Below are the step-by-step instructions on adding, moving, deleting, and resizing a component in Toolpad Studio:

1. Open the component library and drag a component over the canvas.
2. The canvas will highlight the location where the component can be dropped. Release the mouse to drop it.
3. To select a component, click on it either in the canvas or in the page hierarchy explorer. An overlay indicates the selected component.
4. To move a component, drag it from its drag handle in the overlay and drop it at its new location. The canvas will highlight available drop locations with a blue indicator.
5. To delete a component, click the bin icon in the overlay. You can also press the <kbd class="key">Backspace</kbd> key while the component is selected.
6. Components can be horizontally resized within the grid boundaries:

{{"component": "modules/components/DocsImage.tsx", "src": "/static/toolpad/docs/studio/concepts/building-ui/canvas-8.png", "alt": "Resize component", "caption": "Resizing components along columns", "zoom": false }}

Binding dynamic values to these properties is explained in the [data binding](/toolpad/studio/concepts/data-binding/) section.

### Canvas grid

#### Rows

Toolpad Studio canvas uses a grid layout where you can use rows to position components:

{{"component": "modules/components/DocsImage.tsx", "src": "/static/toolpad/docs/studio/concepts/building-ui/canvas-6.png", "alt": "Canvas grid row", "caption": "Canvas grid rows", "zoom": false }}

#### Columns

Or place them in a dedicated column besides other components:

{{"component": "modules/components/DocsImage.tsx", "src": "/static/toolpad/docs/studio/concepts/building-ui/canvas-7.png", "alt": "Canvas grid columns", "caption": "Canvas grid columns", "zoom": false }}
