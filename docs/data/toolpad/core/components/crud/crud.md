# CRUD

<p class="description">The CRUD component provides UIs to interact with data from any data source.</p>

With the `CRUD` component and its subcomponents you can easily generate pages where items from your data source can be listed in a table, shown individually in detail, or created and edited with forms. All with minimal configuration from a single data source definition.

## Demo

The `CRUD` component automatically generates CRUD pages for your data source no matter which framework is being used.
