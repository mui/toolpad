## Community help

Welcome to the Toolpad community!
Toolpad is used by developers and teams all around the world, many of whom actively engage with the community through various online platforms.
These are the best places to start asking questions and looking for answers when you need help.

### GitHub

Toolpad uses GitHub issues to track bug reports and feature requests.

If you think you've found a bug in the codebase, or you have an idea for a new feature, please [search the issues on GitHub](https://github.com/mui/mui-toolpad/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed) before opening a new one, to ensure you're not creating a duplicate.

- [Open an issue on MUI Toolpad](https://github.com/mui/mui-toolpad/issues/new/choose) for issues or feature requests.
- [Start a GitHub discussion](https://github.com/mui/mui-toolpad/discussions) for a broad topic. Here you can engage with the team and the discussion would likely result in one or more GitHub issues.

#### New issue guidelines

- Please follow one of the issue templates provided on GitHub.
- Please use a succinct description that helps others find similar issues.
  - ❌ _"It doesn't work"_
  - ✅ _"Add support for {{new feature}}"_
- Please don't group multiple topics in one issue.
- Please don't comment "+1" on an issue. It spams the maintainers and doesn't help move the issue forward. Use GitHub reactions instead (👍).

### Discord

### Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow contains a wealth of information about MUI products. Toolpad is a new product and you can start by [posting a question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/toolpad) to get help from community experts as well as MUI maintainers.

### Social media

Toolpad has a growing presence on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MUI_Toolpad).
You can use it to share what you're working on and connect with other developers.

Please keep in mind that we don't actively monitor direct messages on the company's social media accounts, so this is _not_ a good way to get in touch with us directly.

### Direct email

If email is your thing, the team can be directly reached out at toolpad@mui.com.
