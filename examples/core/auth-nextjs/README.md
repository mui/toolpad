# Toolpad Core - Next.js App Router

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Setting up

The project requires an `.env.local` with the following variables:

```bash
AUTH_SECRET=
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

### AUTH_SECRET

`AUTH_SECRET` is a random value used by the Auth.js to encrypt tokens and email verification hashes. (See [Deployment](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/deployment) to learn more). You can generate one via running:

```bash
npx auth secret
# or
pnpm create toolpad-app --example auth-nextjs
```

### GitHub configuration

To get the required credentials from GitHub, we need to create an application in their developer settings. Read this [detailed guide on Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/guides/configuring-github) on how to obtain those.

## Clone using `create-toolpad-app`

To copy this example and customize it for your needs, run

```bash
npx create-toolpad-app@latest --example auth-nextjs
```

and follow the instructions in the terminal.

## Deploy on Vercel
